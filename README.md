This script takes data collected from accelerometers from a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone and puts it into a more tidy format. 

1.	To recreate the new dataset download the dataset from the following URL:

	https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

2.	Unzip the files and save them in a folder named “UCI HAR Dataset” off of your project folder.  If you unzip the file in your project folder it should create the folder by default.
3.	Make sure the dplyr and tidyr libraries are installed in your copy of R.
4.	Load run_analysis.R.
5.	Run tidyquiz().
6.	The files AxisMeasurements.csv, NonAxisMeasurements.csv, AxisAverages, and nonAxisAverages will be saved into your project folder.
